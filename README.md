The demo level takes place in a dorm room, where the player character is a mechanical dummy attached to a rail system, restricting movement to slow, left-to-right movements in 3D space. There are no other actors in the scene. The door of the dorm is locked with a three-digit combination lock, which the player must solve to pass the level.

The room contains two interactable objects, that display these clues:

- A photo frame, which shows the following riddle:  
    "Within this frame, a memory hides,  
    A secret waits where truth resides.  
    But only a shift in sight will show,  
    What lies beneath, for you to know."
    
- A computer, which shows another riddle:  
    "Keys arenâ€™t just for locks and doors,  
    Some command, while others store.  
    To shift your view and set things right,  
    Press the key that brings text to light."
    

These riddles hint at a hidden mechanic - pressing the right shift key. When activated, this changes the game's saturation, revealing a hidden code on the dorm room wall - 792. The player must input this code into the door lock to successfully complete the level.
